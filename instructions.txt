REQUIREMENTS
-----------------------------------------------------------
PHP v5.5 or higher.



INTRODUCTION
-----------------------------------------------------------
For this I'll assume you'll already have an Apache, PHP & MySQL 
server setup. If you do not, I'd suggest using software 
like MAMP for OSX or WAMP for Windows.



HOSTS
-----------------------------------------------------------
In an ideal situation, I'd prefer to create a specific 
hostname for this application to be run locally. The 
hostname I've chosen is "rssfeeder.com.local".

OSX: Open up terminal and type "sudo nano /etc/hosts", Add 
a new record for "127.0.0.1 rssfeeder.com.local".

Windows: Open the following file in Notepad 
"C:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc\hosts", Add the same record 
as above; "127.0.0.1 rssfeeder.com.local"



APACHE
-----------------------------------------------------------
If you're using the above hosts method, you'll need to 
ensure Apache is using virtual hosts which will mean 
enabling the file "httpd-vhosts.conf" within apache's 
"httpd.conf" file.

Once that's enabled, you'll need to add the virtual host 
config to the file (See: apache-vhost.conf for an example, 
updating the DocumentRoot with the path to the PUBLIC of the 
app files) "httpd-vhosts.conf" which we've just enabled 
above.

If you're not using the virtual hosts method, you'll need 
to install the website files into the default folder 
location for where Apache runs the website from.

After restarting apache you should be able to see the app 
running if you locate your browser to 
"http://rssfeeder.com.local" or apache's default; 
"http://localhost", albeit, there is probably a error 
message for the database connection - this is the next task.



DATABASE
-----------------------------------------------------------
We'll need to firstly create a new user & database for the 
app to use. Within PhpMyAdmin (PMA), which is shipped with 
MAMP/WAMP, if you click on the "Users" tab, then select
"Add User", fill in the following details:

Database:	rssfeeder
Username:	rssfeeder
Host:		%
Password: 	Lg924o99818P64t

Then tick the box "Create database with same name and grant 
all privileges".

We then need to run the script to add the correct tables for 
our app (See: database.sql). Import this script into the 
rssfeeder database which should add the table "feeds".

After the above is complete, we should then have a database 
with the correct user and table which we can use to connect 
from the application.



APPLICATION
-----------------------------------------------------------
There is a database configuration file located 
in "App/config/database.php". Open up this file and amend 
any of the properties which need to be changed.

Generally the `hostname` will need to be changed to 
127.0.0.1 to account for your server architecture, however, 
if you've not used the above database credentials, you can 
also modify these here too.
